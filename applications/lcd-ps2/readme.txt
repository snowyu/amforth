This is a project of Lubos Pekny (www.forth.cz). 

This application uses a microcontroller, a PS/2 keyboard
and a 4line character LCD only. It does not have a serial
line.

Details on how to setup and use the code can be found in
the schematics and the source files. It's not trivial, please
ask Lubos directly (via the webpage above). His assembler
is needed as well.
