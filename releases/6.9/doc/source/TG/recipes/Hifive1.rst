.. _Hifive1:

=======
Hifive1
=======

An eval board from sifive.

Tools
-----

The easiest way to get working are the riscv packages in Ubuntu Bionic.
They come pre-configured and ready for use. Currently used version is
2.30.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dpkg -l | grep risvc
     ii  binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu  2.30-20ubuntu2~18.04  

To upload the compiled binary, an risc-v enabled `openocd` and a special
`gdb` is needed. Both come from the `sifive.com <https://www.sifive.com/products/tools/>`__
website.

Board Setup
-----------

From the `Freedom E-SDK <https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk/tree/master/bsp/env>`_
download the whole freedom-e300-hifive1 directory and place it at ``risc-v/board/``

Application Setup
-----------------

Checkout amforth svn with at least rev. 2300. It contains an `appl/hifive1`
directory with the necessary files. place the binaries for `openocd` and `gdb`
somewhere in your `PATH` and call `make`.

The Makefile at `hifive/` can upload the hex file to the controller using `openocd`
and `gdb`.

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/amforth/appl/hifive$ make
   openocd -f ~/amforth/risc-v/board/freedom-e300-hifive1/openocd.cfg & \
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb ./amforth.hex --batch -ex "set remotetimeout 240" \
    -ex "target extended-remote localhost:3333" \
    -ex "monitor reset halt" \
    -ex "monitor flash protect 0 64 last off" \
    -ex "load" \
    -ex "monitor resume" \
    -ex "monitor shutdown" \
    -ex "quit" && \
   echo "Successfully uploaded 'amforth.hex' to freedom-e300-hifive1."

   Successfully uploaded 'amforth.hex' to freedom-e300-hifive1.

This shall give the amforth prompt at the serial terminal. Sometimes the
openocd process does not terminate properly. Either kill it manually or start another
make upload to terminate it.

Features
--------

The serial command line uses 38400 8N1.

The RGB led is initialized at boot time and can be accessed with the color command
names ``red``, ``green``, ``blue``, ``white``, ``black`` and a few others.

There is a separate wordlist called `riscv-wordlist` that contains controller
specific words like CSR registers. Use ``riscv-wordlist show-wordlist`` to get 
a listing of the available words. The word ``@cycle`` returns a double cell number 
of the cpu cycles since boot.
