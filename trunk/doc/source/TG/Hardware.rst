Controller
----------

Amforth is designed to run on AVR Atmega
and MSP 430 micro controllers. It requires
8KB flash memory for the basic system.

The ATtiny micro controllers and a a few ATmega types lack
the minimum flash capacity. The ATtiny's lack
some machine instructions as well. The Atxmega 
controller family may be supported in a future
version.
