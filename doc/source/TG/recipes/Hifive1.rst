Tools
-----

From `RISC-V Tools <https://www.sifive.com/products/tools/>`_ download the
files from the section prebuilt RISC-V GCC Toolchain. You need both the embedded toolchain 
and the openocd toolchain.

Unpack the archives and find and put the following files and directories 
into the ``tools`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls tools
    # from riscv-openocd-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6.tar.gz:/share
    share/   
    # from riscv-openocd-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6.tar.gz:/bin
    openocd  
    # from riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6.tar.gz:/bin
    risc64-unknown-elf-gdb 

The ``share`` directory contains many files for a lot of boards. Next find and apply the 
file ``60-openocd.rules`` from this directory tree to your system. Usually at
``/etc/udev/rules.d``. This requires root access with e.g. sudo.

pre-packages binaries can be found here too: `riscv-binutils-bin-64bit-2.28.tar.gz <href=/riscv-binutils-bin-64bit-2.28.tar.gz>`_
they work at least with recent ubuntu versions (64bit). Newer release (2.29 an newer) do work
currently.

Board Setup
-----------

From the `Freedom E-SDK <https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk/tree/master/bsp/env>`_
download the whole freedom-e300-hifive1 directory and place it at ``risc-v/board/``

Application Setup
-----------------

Checkout svn with at least rev. 2300. It contains an appl/hifive1
directory with the necessary files. place the binaries from above
somewhere in PATH and call make.

The Makefile can upload the hex file to the controller using openocd
and gdb as well.

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/amforth/appl/hifive$ make
   openocd -f ~/amforth/risc-v/board/freedom-e300-hifive1/openocd.cfg & \
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb ./amforth.hex --batch -ex "set remotetimeout 240" \
    -ex "target extended-remote localhost:3333" \
    -ex "monitor reset halt" \
    -ex "monitor flash protect 0 64 last off" \
    -ex "load" \
    -ex "monitor resume" \
    -ex "monitor shutdown" \
    -ex "quit" && \
   echo "Successfully uploaded 'amforth.hex' to freedom-e300-hifive1."

   Successfully uploaded 'amforth.hex' to freedom-e300-hifive1.

This shall give the amforth prompt at the serial terminal (38400 8N1). Sometimes the
openocd process does not terminate properly. Either kill it manually or start another
make upload to terminate it.
