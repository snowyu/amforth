AmForth
=======

AmForth is an easily extendible command interpreter for the Atmel
AVR8 Atmega micro controller family and some variants of the
TI MSP430. It has a turnkey feature for embedded use too.

AmForth runs completely on the controller. It does not need additional
hardware beyond a power supply. It makes no restrictions for hardware
extensions that can be connected to the controller.

The command language is `Forth <http://www.forth.org/tutorials.html>`_.
AmForth implements an almost compatible `ANS94 <http://forth.sourceforge.net/std/dpans/>`_
indirect threading 16bit Forth. There are some extensions from the
`Forth 2012 <http://www.forth200x.org/>`_ standard.

The interpreter has a command prompt in a serial terminal. Other
connections like TCP/IP telnet or radio links are possible.

AmForth is published under the GNU Public License v3 (GPL).

AmForth needs 8 to 12 KB Flash memory, 80 bytes EEPROM, and 200 bytes
RAM for the core system.

Karl Lunt has written an excellent :ref:`User Guide`
on how to start and work with AmForth. For those who want
to take a deeper look into the system is the :ref:`Technical Guide`.
The whole documentation is available as `PDF <amforth.pdf>`_
and `EPUB <AmForth.epub>`_.

Work In Progress
................

Here you'll find things that are not yet
released but will be part of the next release.
See the code section at Sourceforge to get the
`most recent sources <http://sourceforge.net/p/amforth/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/>`__

* core(ALL): :command:`name>interpret` and :command:`name>compile` added.
  New Recognizer :command:`rec:name` able to replace :command:`rec:word`. 
  Uses name tokens (Forth 2012) instead of execution tokens.
* core(MSP430): Lots of bugfixes. restructures the init process: :command:`cold` 
  now transfers the data from INFO flash back to RAM if BASE is set and 
  :command:`SAVE` was executed. That way the user code now correctly 
  survives a restart. :command:`SAVE` is much like marker that 
  overwrites the previous state and gets no name.

22.12.2014: release 5.6
.......................

* core(AVR): :command:`icompare` got the same return flag semantics as 
  :command:`compare`. The :command:`leave` and :command:`?do` forward branches
  are now resolved at compile time, saves one cell per loop on the return 
  stack at runtime.
* core(AVR): interrupt vectors are moved from RAM to EEPROM. Saves RAM space
  and simplifies turnkey actions (remove any ``int!`` from your turnkey!)
* core: re-arranged source files: controller specific and common code.
* New architecture: MSP430 (G2553) as used in the :ref:`TI_LaunchPad_430` 
  with code from `Camelforth <http://www.camelforth.com>`__ and 
  `4â‚¬4th <http://www.somersetweb.com/4E4th/EN.html>`__.
* core: generalized existing :ref:`Stacks` in EEPROM into :command:`map-stack`, 
  :command:`get-stack` and :command:`set-stack`. Used for the search order
  and recognizer stacks.
* all: changed license to GPLv3.
